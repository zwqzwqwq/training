          ABOUT ME
        </h1>

        <p className='about-content'>
        I have wide research interests, mainly including artificial intelligence, machine learning, data mining, pattern recognition, evolutionary computation and multimedia retrieval, among which machine learning and data mining are my core research areas. I am particularly interested in the problem of how to enable computing machines to handle "ambiguity".
